I used the Git Bash CMD!

confirm the current directory of the file in order to type and activate the "python manage.py runserver which will display 
the web app when localhost:8000 is searched on the website.

Step 1 on CMD
change directory to the file name 'simpleblog'

Step 2 on CMD
next, you create a virtual environment type this on the CMD type -> 'python -m venv virt'
then activate it by typing 'source virt\Scripts\activate'

Step 3 on CMD
type -> 'ls' on your CMD it lets you see what's inside the simpleblog folder and virt which indicates that the viritual environment is still active.

Step 4 on CMD
Now you change directory to the name of the folder you see. type --> 'cd folder name/'    ie: cd myblog/

Step 5 on CMD
Then you type 'python manage.py runserver' on your CMD, go to your browser and type -> 'localhost:8000 and click enter. 
when you click enter it will display the blog home page.
and when you also go to your browser and type -> 'localhost:8000/admin it shows the django database.




The myblog folder contains (Members,myblog,theblog)
'Members' was created to take care of user authentication, login, logout and registration.
theblog was created for the user to view blog home page all available blog post, the ability to add post, update post and even delete post
